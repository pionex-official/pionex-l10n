The main parameters are the MA period and standard deviation multiplier. Bollinger Bands can provide information about price volatility and overbought or oversold conditions:\n\n1.Volatility: When the Bollinger Bands widen, i.e., the distance between the two lines increases, it implies an increase in market volatility. When the Bollinger Bands narrow, i.e., the distance between the two lines decreases, it suggests reduced market volatility.\n\n2.Overbought or Oversold: When the price touches or breaches the upper line, it may indicate an overbought market. Likewise, when the price touches or breaches the lower line, it may suggest an oversold market.\n\nAlthough Bollinger Bands can provide valuable information, investors should be aware that no technical indicator can predict market movements with 100% accuracy. Bollinger Bands are best used in conjunction with other technical indicators and market analysis tools to provide a more comprehensive view and further confirm potential trading signals. ",

When the price breaks through these points, it indicates that the current trend may end and a new trend may begin, which stands for \"Stop and Reverse\".\n\nPlease note that although SAR can provide potential market turning points, it cannot guarantee absolute accuracy.

It is generated by calculating the difference between the exponential moving averages (EMA) of two different periods, usually these two periods are 12 days (short term) and 26 days (long term). The DIFF line (also called the MACD line) is derived by subtracting the 26-day EMA from the 12-day EMA. The DEA line (also known as the signal line) is obtained by smoothing the DIFF line again for a certain period (usually 9 days) of EMA. The \"Histogram\" is derived by calculating the difference between the DIFF line and the DEA line.\n\nMACD’s main uses are as follows:\n\n1.Trend Confirmation: When the DIFF line crosses the DEA line from below, it is often seen as a signal of an uptrend. Conversely, it is seen as a signal of a downtrend.\n\n2.Divergence: When the price forms a new high point (or a new low point), and the DIFF line does not form a new high point (or a new low point), this could be a reversal signal.\n\nLike other technical analysis tools, the effectiveness of MACD depends on several other factors, including the conditions of the chosen market and the use of other indicators and patterns in combination. Therefore, investors should get a full understanding and familiarity with the usage and limitations of MACD before investing. ",

Of course, it is necessary to combine other market information and technical indicators when applying it, in order to make more accurate judgments. ",
    "indicator_sub_RSI_title": "Relative Strength Index",

If the parameter is set to 12, this means that the recent 12 price changes are taken into consideration during the calculation of RSI. This setting can be adjusted according to the trading strategy and the market conditions. For example, if you are trading frequently in the short term (such as intraday trading or swing trading), you might want to adjust the parameter to a smaller value (like 5 or 10) to obtain a more sensitive reading. Conversely, if you are a long-term investor, you may want to set the parameter to a larger value (like 20 or 30), this helps to filter out noise from smaller cycles and better capture long-term trends.\n\nThe calculation formula of RSI is: \n\nRSI = 100 - [100 / (1 + RS) ]\n\nWhere:\n\nRS = Average Gain / Average Loss\n\nAverage Gain = the average positive price movement of the closing prices from the past N periods\n\nAverage Loss = the average negative price movement of the closing prices from the past N periods\n\nYou must bear in mind that different parameter settings may yield different results. Therefore, before deciding on the parameter settings, it's best to conduct some backtesting to confirm how the selected parameters have performed in the past. Furthermore, regardless of the parameter settings, the end goal should be to find the settings that best reflect your trading strategy and risk tolerance. ",
    "indicator_sub_StochRsi_title": "Stochastic RSI",
    "indicator_sub_StochRsi_desc": "Stoch RSI is an oscillation indicator, integrated from two individual indicators, RSI (Relative Strength Index) and Stochastic. The purpose of Stoch RSI is to enhance the sensitivity of RSI by measuring its position relative to its own historical performance, thus generating trading signals more quickly. In other words, the Stoch RSI is the RSI of the RSI itself. When Stoch RSI is above 0.80, it may indicate an overbought condition. When Stoch RSI is below 0.20, it may suggest an oversold condition. \n\nHowever, it should be noted that although Stoch RSI can produce trading signals faster, it may also generate more false signals. Hence, it is recommended to combine Stoch RSI with other types of analytical methods and indicators to improve the accuracy of the analysis.",
    "indicator_sub_TRIX_title": "Triple Exponential Moving Average",
    "indicator_sub_TRIX_desc": "TRIX belongs to the category of trend and oscillation indicators. It is an oscillation indicator based on three smoothed moving averages, and it aims to identify overbuying or overselling opportunities in the market by observing the cyclical changes in price trends. The steps to calculate TRIX are as follows:\n\n1. First, calculate the N-day exponential moving average (EMA) of daily prices. This is the first smoothing.\n\n2. Then, based on the EMA calculated in the first step, calculate the EMA again. This is the second smoothing.\n\n3. For the third step, calculate the EMA based on the EMA from the second step. This is the third smoothing.\n\n4. Finally, calculate the percentage change of the third EMA and transform it into a percentage to get the TRIX value.\n\nTRIX indicators oscillate around 0. Positive values indicate an upward price trend, while negative values indicate a downward price trend. Like all indicators, TRIX should not be used alone to generate buy and sell signals, and it'd be best to use it in conjunction with other indicators and analytical techniques.",
    "indicator_sub_OBV_title": "On Balance Volume",
    "indicator_sub_OBV_desc": "OBV, belonging to volume indicators, is a momentum indicator that combines price and trading volume, used to evaluate the situation of money inflow or outflow. Simply put: When today's closing price is higher than yesterday's, today's trading volume is added to yesterday's OBV; when today's closing price is lower than yesterday's, today's trading volume is subtracted from yesterday's OBV; when today's closing price equals yesterday's, OBV remains the same. This process continues to accumulate an OBV value.\nBy comparing the trend of OBV and the trend of prices, you can evaluate the buying and selling pressure of an asset. If the price rises in sync with OBV, this consistency generally signifies that an upward trend may continue. On the contrary, if OBV is inconsistent with the price trend (for example, the price continues to rise but OBV starts to fall), this may be a warning signal, indicating that the current price trend may soon reverse.\nPlease note, OBV does not provide absolute buy and sell signals, it is merely an analytical tool and should be used in conjunction with other technical analysis methods and indicators.",
    "indicator_sub_WR_title": "Williams %R",
    "indicator_sub_WR_desc": "WR belongs to oscillating indicators. It calculates the degree of overbuying and overselling in the market based on the highest price, lowest price, and closing price over a recent period. The steps to calculate the WR indicator are as follows:\n\n1. Choose a predetermined calculation period (usually 14 days).\n\n2. Calculate the highest price (Highest High) during this period.\n\n3. Calculate the lowest price (Lowest Low) during this period.\n\n4. Calculate the latest closing price (Close).\n\n5. Subtract the latest closing price from the highest price, then divide by the difference between the highest and lowest price to calculate the WR value.\n\nThe formula is: WR = [(Highest High - Close) / (Highest High - Lowest Low)] * -100%\n\nIts range is between 0 and -100. If the WR value is close to 0% (e.g., -10%), this is generally considered an overbought signal, meaning the price may fall; when WR is close to -100% (e.g., -90%), this is usually regarded as an oversold signal, indicating that the price may rise. Like all technical indicators, WR should also be used in conjunction with other technical analysis indicators and chart patterns to improve the accuracy of decision-making. Regardless of the situation, careful risk management is needed for all trading decisions.",
    "indicator_sub_CCI_title": "Commodity Channel Index",
    "indicator_sub_CCI_desc": "CCI falls under both trending and oscillating indicators, mainly used to determine overbought and oversold conditions in the market as well as potential trend reversals. CCI is calculated by comparing the price with its average price and its normal deviation. When the CCI exceeds +100, it may indicate that the price has entered an overbought phase and there is a possibility of price retracement. Conversely, when the CCI falls below -100, it may signify that the price has entered an oversold phase, and there could be potential rebounds. Moreover, during periods of trading range, a definitive trending line can be established using linear regression for CCI, and crossings of this trend line could serve as entry and exit signals. However, like all other technical indicators, CCI does not guarantee 100% accuracy. This factor should be considered when making trading decisions, and other analysis tools or methods should also be employed.\n\n",
    "indicator_sub_ROC_title": "Rate of Change",
    "indicator_sub_ROC_desc": "ROC is an oscillating indicator used to measure the rate of price changes over a certain period. ROC calculates the speed of price changes by comparing the current price with the price at a certain point in the past. This speed can be positive (indicating a price increase) or negative (indicating a price decrease). The ROC is presented as a percentage and it can help traders identify overbought or oversold conditions in the market, as well as potential reversal signals. When the ROC identifies positive (rising) momentum and it's strengthening, it might indicate that the market is in a bull phase (rising). Conversely, if the ROC shows negative (falling) momentum and it's strengthening, the market might be in a bear phase (falling). \n\nHowever, like all other technical indicators, the ROC cannot guarantee 100% accuracy.

VR is calculated by separately tallying the trading volumes on rising and falling days within a specific period, and then coming up with their ratio. Specifically, it is the ratio of the sum of the trading volumes on rising days to the sum of the trading volumes on falling days. \n\nVR reflects the buying and selling intentions of the market participants within a certain timeframe, thus helping us judge the market sentiment and possible direction. Generally, when VR is more than 100, it suggests stronger buying pressure, and the market might rise; when VR is less than 100, it indicates stronger selling pressure, and the market might decline. \n\nHowever, do note that though VR can help us analyze buying and selling pressure in the market, it does not directly provide buy/sell signals. Therefore, it should be used in conjunction with other types of technical analysis methods to gain a more comprehensive view of the market.",
    "indicator_sub_PSY_title": "Psychological Line",
    "indicator_sub_PSY_desc": "PSY is part of sentiment indicators. It measures the ratio of rising days to total trading days over a certain period to express the market's optimism or pessimism. In calculations, if the closing price of a day is higher than the previous day's closing price, the day is considered a rising day, otherwise it's a non-rising day. The PSY value is the ratio of the number of rising days to the total trading days in a period, which is then multiplied by 100, typically resulting in a value between 0 and 100. \n\nThe PSY indicator provides us a simple and intuitive way to assess the overall sentiment in the market. For instance, a high PSY value may imply an overly optimistic market, potentially facing the risk of correction, while a low PSY value may indicate an overly pessimistic market with chances of a rebound. \n\nHowever,  like all technical indicators, PSY cannot be independently used for making trading decisions, it is merely a reference tool, and is best used in conjunction with other indicators and analysis methods.",

The long-term moving average usually observes a longer period, such as the average price over the past 50 days, while the short-term moving average looks at a shorter time frame, such as the average price over the most recent 10 days. The value of DMA is the difference between the short-term moving average and the long-term moving average.\n\nWhen the short-term moving average crosses the long-term moving average from below, this is typically seen as a buying signal because it indicates that the recent price is rising and breaking through the average level of a longer time period. Conversely, when the short-term moving average crosses the long-term moving average from above, this is usually interpreted as a selling signal because it shows a declining price trend.\n\nLastly, please note that DMA is just an auxiliary tool. While it can provide valuable insights, it does not guarantee 100% accuracy. Therefore, it's best to use the DMA indicator in conjunction with other technical analysis tools and fundamental analysis to form more comprehensive and reliable investment decisions.",

This can help investors identify opportunities for larger price changes with smaller volumes, or conversely, identify circumstances where larger volumes might only result in smaller price changes. Here are some usual cases:\n\n1.Positive EMV: When the EMV line is above zero, it suggests that the market faces less resistance in moving prices, and prices might have an upward trend.\n\n2.Negative EMV: When the EMV line is below zero, it suggests that the market faces more resistance in moving prices, and prices might have a downward trend.\n\n3.Zero EMV: An EMV of zero typically indicates that although price changes may exist during the calculation period, these price changes are not backed up by sufficient volume to cause significant price movement.\n\n4.EMV Starts Changing Direction: If the EMV line begins to change direction, either upwards or downwards, this could imply that the price trend is shifting.\n\n5.EMV is inconsistent with price trend: If the EMV diverges with the price trend, this could indicate that there could be a price reversal trend ahead.\n\nHowever, like all other technical analysis tools, EMV cannot guarantee 100% accuracy and should not be used independently.
